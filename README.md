# Stock dynamics
###About the app

It is a very simple shiny app that shows the stock trends over the time period selected by the user. In, addition to providing the graphical view of stock trend the app also provides textual summary of the stock performance over the selected time period. In, addition the app also outputs top 10 obervations in the table format. This apps heavily makes use of the quantmod package in R.
Overall, it is a very simple application that I have developed as a learning exercise for the class. I understand that there are already so many similar applications. Therefore, I have tried to combined both graphical and text information in the the same app to be a bit different from what already exists on the web. I hope you will like the app!
